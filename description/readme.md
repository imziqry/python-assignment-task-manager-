Python Study Planner Project

This project is part of my Python programming assignment. The goal of this program is to store, display, and organize tasks based on user input, including features like tracking deadlines, priorities, and progress.

I’m using this repository to track my progress as I learn Python, so feel free to suggest improvements or make changes to the code—I welcome any collaboration!

📝 Assignment Overview

Challenge: Study Planner with Priority & Deadline Tracking
Objective: Manage tasks, set deadlines, track progress, and sort tasks by urgency.

Requirements implemented in this project:

Variables, Input/Output, and Data Types – Clear definition of variables, proper handling of user inputs, and appropriate use of data types.

Decision Structures – Conditional statements (if, elif, else) applied where relevant.

Loops – for and while loops, including nested loops where needed.

Multiple Data Structures – At least two data structures (list, tuple, set, dictionary) are used.

User-Defined Functions – Six or more functions implemented, each performing a specific task.

Exception Handling – try/except blocks to manage invalid inputs or runtime errors.

Modular and Readable Code – Clean structure, meaningful variable names, and comments for clarity.

⚡ Notes

I’m still learning Python, so please bear with me if the code is not perfect.

Any suggestions, improvements, or contributions are highly welcome.
